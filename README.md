# WinOS-Kernel
A basic operating system kernel, by me. This will be updated everyday if I have time. This kernel is based on https://github.com/iknowbrain/NIDOS. 

Again, this is a kernel. You could infact boot / test the kernel with qemu-system-i386 -kernel /boot/kernel.bin

The code will be uploaded to here soon. 

## About this kernel

This project is based on https://github.com/iknowbrain/NIDOS and will be updated everytime when I have time coding C :) There is a lot of weird bugs on the kernel, so if you want to contibrute to the project, you can! 

This kernel is made for fun and for educational pusposes only.
